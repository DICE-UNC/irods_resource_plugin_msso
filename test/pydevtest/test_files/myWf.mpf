# Identify the stage area where the workflowexecution is performed
#    by default it is performed at the "bin" directory of the iRODS server.
# This is needed if one is using msiExecCmd micro-service as part of the workflow.
#STAGEAREA bin
# 
# Stage in files from anywhere in iRODS to the "stage area"
# myData is a file located in the WSO and photo.JPG is a file somewhere else in iRODS.
STAGEIN myData
STAGEIN /tempZone/home/rods/PHOTO.JPG
#
# Stage back additional files created as part of run
# COPYOUT - will leave a copy in the "stage area" and make a copy in iRODS WSO 
#         - helpful if it is needed by subsequent workflow execution
# STAGEOUT - will move file from "stage area" to iRODS WSO
# In this case we are archiving the two files myData and photo.JPG as well as the "myWorkFlow" file 
used 
# by the workflow execution.
COPYOUT myWorkFlow
STAGEOUT myData
STAGEOUT PHOTO.JPG

#The next set of statement provide directives to the workflow system.
# CHECKFORCHANGE is used for testing wthere the file being checked has changed since the
#   previous execution of the workflow. If the file is modified/touched then the workflow is
#   executed. If none of the files are changed, then the workflow is not executed. If directed, the
#   file from previous execution is "sent back" to the client.
# NOVERSION is used when versioning of old results is not needed. 
# CLEANOUT is used to clear the stage area after execution.
